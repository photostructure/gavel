# Gavel

Open the requested diff, guide the reader, and handle feedback within the approved
scope. A viewer request alone grants no edit or commit permission. Do not post PR
findings to GitHub. Make authorized fixes only in the owning checkout.

## Zero idle model turns

Work only on user messages or human review feedback. An open review, connected
browser, empty result, timeout, or process exit is not work. Never poll, sleep,
run `gavel wait`, schedule a monitor, or keep a subagent alive awaiting review.
Do not reread unchanged snapshots or process output on a timer.

Read one snapshot per server on resume; read another only for newly delivered
feedback, version conflicts, or the final approval check. If recovery repeats
without new state, preserve pending work, report the problem, and end the turn.
See [Wait for feedback](#wait-for-feedback) for delivery.

## Choose the scope

- With no named target, show this session's uncommitted paths and hunks in a named
  review. Exclude other sessions' work, including changes in the same file.
- If this session's work is already committed, list its short SHAs and subjects
  and ask whether to show them. Use each commit's own message; for a range, use
  one subject per line. Keep approvals on for unlanded commits:
  `git merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> <base>` exits 1. Use `--no-lgtm` once every
  target commit's check returns 0.
- For a named branch, commit, range, or PR (`--pr <url>`), review for defects
  before launching. Seek approval by default; use `--no-lgtm` when the user
  explicitly requests read-only review or every target commit has already landed.
- Show one commit as `<sha>`; show consecutive commits as
  `<last-sha> <first-sha>^` for one approval, or as a stack for separate approvals.
  If unrelated commits intervene, name them and ask whether to include them or
  show this session's commits separately. Use immutable SHAs when approval matters.

## Size and group reviews

Honor the user's grouping, including one whole diff. Otherwise aim for about
300 weighted changed lines per review, with no file-count cap. Count additions
and deletions with `git apply --numstat < <patch>`, or
`git diff --numstat HEAD -- <paths>` for native tracked changes (`<base> <target>`
for commits). Add scoped untracked text lines; exclude unrelated paths/hunks.
Weights: tests 0.2, config 0.5, complicated SQL/concurrency/native code 1.5,
lockfiles and reproducible generated/vendored output 0, everything else 1.
AI-written code and prose are not generated output.

This is a heuristic, not a validated cutoff. Consider raw counts too: discounts
must not hide the reading burden. The
[Cisco study](https://static0.smartbear.co/support/media/resources/cc/book/code-review-cisco-case-study.pdf)
favors a few hundred inspected lines;
[Google](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/small-cls.html)
favors self-contained changes without excessive splitting.

Split larger changes by purpose, in dependency order. Keep tests, docs, and plans
with their implementation; separate refactors from behavior changes. Each review
needs one purpose, not a catch-all such as “misc” or “cleanup.” Keep files whole
unless a modified file alone exceeds the budget; then split its hunks, with
`--select` for uncommitted work or a separate patch per part for committed work.
A new, deleted, renamed, binary, or mode-changed file cannot be split, so one over
the budget gets its own review.
A reproducible mechanical sweep gets its own review regardless of size; put the
command in its rationale. An oversized commit range needs a stack, with oversized
commits split further.

Name related parts in order, such as `task-9a-schema` and `task-9b-server`. Start
each rationale with its place (“Task 9, part A of 3”) and refer to other parts by
tab name. Make separate commits when parts build and pass tests independently.
Otherwise use one commit across reviews, the same proposed message on each, and
commit exactly their captured union after every part is approved. When a comment
asks for a different message on one part, write it to that part only with
`comment summary`; the other parts keep the message their reviewer saw.

## Prepare and launch

Use separate servers for Claude Code and Codex. Never add either host's reviews
to the other's server: final-verdict handoff follows the launching host.

Run from the reviewed Git root. Use the prescribed launcher as `<gavel-command>`.
If none is prescribed, locate an installed executable and verify its package is
`@photostructure/gavel`; report absence rather than install or guess. Check
`--version` and `--help` for `--review`, `--background`, and `--jsonl`. Use that
build throughout; report missing capabilities. The unscoped `gavel` package is
an unrelated HTTP validator; `difit` is upstream's viewer.

Before a review you initiate, run `<gavel-command> idle` once. A nonzero exit or
`idleMs >= 600000` means do not launch: finish tests and independent review,
report readiness, and end the turn. Do not poll. Skip this check when the latest
user message explicitly requests review.

For uncommitted work:

```sh
<gavel-command> --review <task-name> --title '<short description>' --keep-alive
```

Pass `--title` on every launch. Keep it short: browsers only show the first 10-20
characters.

Names contain 1–80 ASCII letters, digits, dots, underscores, or hyphens and start
with a letter or digit. Repeat `--pathspec <git-pathspec>` for native Git filters
and exclusions; add `--include-untracked` when needed. Verify the captured patch
matches the requested scope. Capture operations leave the index and files intact.
For commits, use `<gavel-command> <target> [base]`; unnamed `.`, `working`, and
`staged` targets remain available.

To select overlapping hunks, capture once and use that artifact's catalogue IDs:

```sh
<gavel-command> review capture --pathspec src --output /tmp/capture.json
<gavel-command> --review parser-fix --capture /tmp/capture.json --select '<hunk-id>' --keep-alive
```

Repeat `--select` for files or hunks. IDs belong to the artifact's digest and
repository root; binary and rename-only changes require file IDs. Import a patch
with `<gavel-command> - --review <name> < <patch>`. Pathspecs and untracked-file
options apply only to native captures. If external clean/process filters block
capture, including in submodules, narrow the paths or explicitly prepare a patch
or capture artifact.

Retain a foreground server's process handle. Read `server.ready` for the API
port, PID, and review identity; share `launchUrl`, including its editor-session
fragment. Use that host/API port for companion commands, never Vite's UI port.
JSONL is the default; diagnostics go to stderr. Named reviews and JSONL require
conversation APIs; unnamed reviews can disable both with `--no-jsonl --no-conversation`.
Use `--keep-alive` for review rounds and `--no-lgtm` for read-only reviews.

`--background` detaches without opening a browser or streaming stdout. Share the `url` in its
`server.background` record; recover state through snapshots. It cannot read a named
patch from stdin: launch unnamed on `HEAD --background --keep-alive` without
`--comment`, `--commit-message`, or `--why`. Then create the named review from
stdin, add comments and summary, and set the URL's `review` query to its name.
This keeps the bootstrap from becoming a review tab.

**About** identifies the launching agent/session from the environment and, for
Codex, its rollout. Override wrong or missing values with `--agent` and
`--agent-session-id`; pass `--agent` for nested `claude -p`, which inherits the
parent entrypoint. Set `--agent-session-name` only when known. Reused servers
retain the launching session's identity.

## Add reviews and refresh captures

Use one server and share one link; tabs follow creation order. Add uncommitted
work with `review create <name> --host <host> --port <port> [--pathspec ...]`. It returns a
`reviewId`. Launch comment and summary options affect only the first review: give every added review
its own `comment add --review <name>` comments and `comment summary` proposal.

For existing commits, launch the first SHA with its message and `--keep-alive`;
add later commits in order:

```sh
git diff --full-index <sha>^ <sha> | <gavel-command> review create <name> - --host <host> --port <port>
```

The `-` is required. Each approval covers its own review and permits landing an
existing commit. Fixes belong in new reviewed commits; do not amend or rebase
reviewed commits without permission. Remote-reachable commits remain immutable.

To split existing commits, branches, or PRs, fetch the PR head if needed and
prepare `git diff --full-index <base> <target> -- <paths>` per part. For a
branch/PR, use `git merge-base <landing-branch> <target>` as `<base>` to exclude
newer landing commits; include both names of renamed files. Pipe the first
patch to `<gavel-command> - --review <name> --keep-alive`, later patches to
`review create <name> - --host <host> --port <port>`, or use the detached procedure
above. Require every part's snapshot approval; `approval status <sha>` matches
only whole-commit patches.

Named captures are frozen; edits and browser reloads do not refresh them. Before
`review update <name> --host <host> --port <port> --expected-version <n>`, read
`GET /api/reviews/<name>`. Repeat the intended source: `-` for a patch, native
`--pathspec`/`--include-untracked`, or `--capture` with selectors. Update does not
reuse filters; omitting them captures the whole uncommitted tree. Reconcile HTTP
409 before retrying. An identical patch preserves version and approval; a changed
patch advances the version and moves Approve to it. Never recapture while idle.

Rename with `review rename <name> <new-name> --host <host> --port <port>`; `reviewId`,
comments, proposal, and verdict stay. Delete an unwanted review you created with
`review delete <name> --host <host> --port <port>`, freeing its name. Comments
remain in **Conversation** until shutdown, but the saved capture is deleted:
`review unapply`/`review reapply` can no longer find it. Keep reviews you may still unapply or reapply.
Do not restart to remove one review: that removes every review's comments from
the page. Never rename or delete another session's review.

Reopening the same named patch or commits restores saved conversations, proposals,
and approval, but review IDs and event cursors change. Snapshot before sending
status, replies, or summaries. Report `store.error`: review changes are not being
saved. `approval status <sha>` also reads saved approval after server shutdown.

## Guide the reader

Every review, including read-only reviews, needs a summary and reading-guide
comments. Use repeatable `--comment` arguments or `comment add` on a running
server. Discover payloads with `schema import` and command `--help`.

```sh
<gavel-command> <target> [base] --keep-alive \
  --comment '{"type":"thread","filePath":"src/example.ts","position":{"side":"new","line":36},"body":"Start here: ..."}'
```

Anchor one point per comment, using `old` for deletions or `new` for target lines
and a line number or `{"start":36,"end":39}`. Give a starting point and reading order unless
the diff is one hunk. Explain non-obvious reasons, oddities, moved replacements,
indirect tests, and skippable mechanical changes. Label proposed refactors as suggestions
with reasons; prefix verified defects with “Finding:”. Skip self-explanatory
lines, use the user's language, and exclude credentials.

For more than a few hunks, link comments into a tour. Prefix thread `id`s with
the review name so they are unique across the server. Links can target
`[next](#thread=<id>)`, `[parser](#file=<path>&line=40-52)` (add `&side=old` for
deletions), or `[API half](?review=<name>#thread=<id>)`. Back returns to the source;
unfollowable links show a notice. Link only to captured hunks. End `--why` with
the tour's first link, such as `Start here: [parser](#thread=<id>)`.

Supply a Conventional Commit via `--commit-message` and one to three sentences
explaining the problem and solution via `--why`. Identify inferred intent for
others' work. For added reviews, send `comment summary` JSON on stdin:
`{reviewId,commitMessage,rationale,baseVersion}`. Read `summary.version` from a
snapshot; saved proposals mean `baseVersion` may not be 0. Commit with the saved
message; write requested message changes with `comment summary` first.

## Handle feedback

Read [feedback and snapshot commands](references/feedback.md) before handling a
batch or resuming a review. Read `comment snapshot` as it describes, during review and
for the final approval check. Read new foreground JSONL between
tool steps. There is no `comment watch` command.

Handle human comments and edits; agent events, capture/progress/thread changes,
and deletions update state but do not request work. Save IDs, revision cursors,
and pending work before acknowledging messages. Output alone is not a receipt.
Answer every pending comment with `comment reply`, or mark it `noted` with
`comment status` if no answer is needed. Replies and Noted do not resolve threads;
resolve or delete only on request. Comment intent does not grant authorization.
Reconcile a snapshot after missed output, restart, or HTTP 409.

## Wait for feedback

Record pending work, share the URL, and end the turn. No polling, sleeps, timed
waits, Monitors, custom waiters, or `<gavel-command> wait`.

In Claude Code, servers launched with `CLAUDE_CODE_MESSAGING_SOCKET` and
`CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` in the Bash environment send human verdicts/comments to
that session's inbox. This includes `--background` and added reviews. Tell the
user verdicts arrive automatically unless `crossSessionInbound` is `hold` or
`refuse`, or unset while the session bypasses permissions; Claude may withhold
those messages. Notifications start `gavel: new review activity` and contain
human events since the previous message. Handle them as feedback batches;
read a fresh snapshot before acting on a verdict. The notification itself is
not approval. Subagent-launched reviews report to the main session.

If the user reports missing feedback, run `<gavel-command> pending` once to see
activity that failed delivery. Without the environment variables, with inbound
messages held/refused, or with `--no-conversation` (no inbox), use the manual handoff below.
For Codex, follow the [Codex skill](https://github.com/photostructure/gavel/blob/main/.codex/skills/gavel/SKILL.md):
its server can queue feedback and offers manual recovery. In other hosts, ask
the user to paste **Copy resume prompt** into this chat or send a message when
ready. Copying alone does not resume the agent.

Subagents never wait: return a launch command and capture artifact, or a detached
server's URL, review IDs, API port, and pending work to the main session.

## Act on verdicts

Read a fresh snapshot before acting; the user can clear or switch a verdict.

- **Approve** (`verdict: "approve"`): act on every user message in unresolved
  threads, including messages added before the final snapshot, plus feedback
  outside gavel. Then commit, and close the server as described below. If a request is impossible or unclear, explain
  and do not commit. Nothing tracks completed comments; the verdict stays until
  cleared. See the [approval guide](https://github.com/photostructure/gavel/blob/main/docs/approval-modes.md).
- **Reject** (`verdict: "reject"`): do not revise, recapture, or commit. Ask what
  to do instead, and close the server as described below.
- **No verdict** (absent or `null`): await the user.

After Reject, ask in this session what the user wants instead, using the review's
comments as context, and whether to revert. Say what each revert step would
undo, then act on the user's answer without asking again:

- In a worktree of your own: `git worktree remove --force <path>`, then
  `git branch -D <branch>`. `--force` deletes uncommitted and untracked files for good,
  and deleting the branch deletes its reflog: give the tip SHA (`git rev-parse <branch>`)
  in your reply first, since it is the only way back until `git gc` prunes it.
- For unpushed commits this session made at the branch tip (`git branch -r --contains <oldest>`
  prints nothing): note the tip SHA, run `git reset --soft <oldest>^`, then
  `git diff --full-index <oldest>^ <tip> | git apply --cached -R`. That unstages only those
  commits' hunks and leaves the changes in the working tree to redo; `git restore --staged`
  would also unstage other sessions' hunks in the same files. If `git apply` fails, it
  changed nothing: tell the user the rejected changes are still staged. To discard them
  instead, treat them as uncommitted edits. A pushed range, or one with another session's commit on top,
  gets a `git revert` commit, under the usual commit approval.
- For uncommitted edits in a shared checkout from a named review: put the output of
  `<gavel-command> review unapply <name> --dry-run` in your question. If the name is
  ambiguous, that run lists each saved capture's digest instead: rerun the dry run with
  `--patch-digest <the rejected review's digest>` and put that output in the question. On a
  yes, run `review unapply <name> --patch-digest <patchDigest from the dry run>`. It runs
  `git apply -R` on that capture's patch, after a stash of the tracked files. `refused` means
  nothing changed; `rejected` lists hunks it left in place: report either. `review reapply
  <name> --patch-digest <digest>` undoes it. For other reviews, ask how:
  `git stash push` takes whole files and resets the shared index, so it can take another
  session's work.

Only the user clears a Reject. Never recapture a rejected review; put a new attempt
up as a new named review.

Approve on your review authorizes a commit. After addressing comments, passing
required checks, and independent Codex/Claude reviewers LAND the final code,
read a fresh `comment snapshot` immediately before committing; require
`approval.verdict: approve`. Approval follows recaptures and summary edits;
other sessions' staged hunks do not end it.

Commit only the approved capture and requested fixes, using the saved message.
Shared-tree edits gain no approval. Commit independent parts in dependency order;
parts that must land together need every approval before their single commit.
Clearing a verdict ends button approval; after restart, only fresh state counts.
Chat approval is independent. Silence or tab closure is not approval. Approval
never authorizes pushing or publishing.

Close a server you launched once the user has given every review on it a verdict,
in gavel or in chat, and you have carried that verdict out: committed an Approve,
or asked about a Reject. A read-only (`--no-lgtm`) review counts once the user
says they are done with it; the unnamed `HEAD` bootstrap of a detached launch does
not count. Keep it running if the user asked you to. Send SIGTERM to the `pid`
from its `server.ready` or `server.background` record (`kill -TERM <pid>`), and
say in your report that you closed it. If a snapshot's `store.error` says changes
are not being saved, report it and ask before closing. Never stop another
session's server.
